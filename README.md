# Computer Vision Lab: Impact of Sunglasses on Face Recognition

## Overview

This Google Colab notebook is designed for young students in South Bend to explore the effects of sunglasses and artificial sunglasses on face recognition similarity scores. The notebook provides a hands-on experiment where students can capture live images, align faces using Adaface, recognize faces with Arcface, and modify images with PicsArt to add artificial sunglasses.


### Goals

* Understand the impact of physical and artificial sunglasses on face recognition systems.
* Learn how face alignment and recognition algorithms work.
* Gain hands-on experience with image processing and computer vision techniques.
